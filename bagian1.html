	<p>Welcome to my very first website. To start, I would like to share to you the list of the things I interested in :
		<br><ul><b><li>Reading self-improvement book</li></b>
			<p1>I believe the only person who knows yourself better is none other than YOU! So I decided to learn from someone's experience and apply whatever relevant to the situation I am in.</p1>
			<b><li>Spiritual fulfilment, including meditation and breathing exercise</li></b>
			<p1>I am still learning to be the best version of myself, and being close to God I believed in is the absolute way to get there. I believe, all the things happen in this universe is related to each other.</p1>
			<b><li>low-pace home workout</li></b>
			<p1>Simply because I'm easy-to-give-up person haha. By doing low-pace execise at home, I can minimize the movement, so that I don't have any excuses to not maintain my physical health</p1>
			<b><li>Experiencing new thing</li></b>
			<p1><i>A pinch of salt won't ruin your life, right?</i></p1>
			<b><li>Sleep!</li></b>
			<p1>NO EXPLANATION HAHA!</p1>
		</ul>
